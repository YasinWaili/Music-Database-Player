ABOUT:
The basis of this project is a music streaming application that allows users to create profiles, and listen to music that is stored in the database. Users are also able to create their
own personalized playlist by pressing the add to playlist button on the music.

HOW TO USE:
- You must add mp4 files to the /public/audio file.
- Add the songs to the database using a insert script. (An example insert script is in the data folder)
- Start the server in a terminal with node server.js
- Create a user or login if you already have an account in the database.
- Search for songs with the search bar and enjoy!
